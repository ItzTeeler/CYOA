(Description) - Website will have a title page where you will be prompted a button to play. Play through the story with 6 fixed endings. For each ending you will be able to return back to the title page.

  - Comments: Loved the story, it was very entertaining. Styling was consistent and every button linked correctly to the next page. I would recommend changing the title, since it's just set to Document right now. I liked that in your CSS it was efficient, such as saying h1,h2, h3{} rather than separately typing them. Classes are used more broadly, while IDs are used a single time since it has the most specificity. I would recommend not using it too much, since it's hard to manipulate. I liked that you used ID selectors though!! But either way, your use of classes or IDs work. Overall nice job!!!
