        the side of the road. He decides to pull over to see if he could take it home, since he loves llamas. He somehow
        managed to fit the llama inside the passenger seat of the lamborghini and drive home. Isaiah gets home safely
        with a llama, while he happily kicks his feet to sleep.</p>
