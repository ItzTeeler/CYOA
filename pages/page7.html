    <p>Isaiah is super sad when he drives home. On the way home we saw a cute llama on the side of the road. He decides to pull over to see if he could take it home, since he loves llamas. He somehow managed to fit the llama inside the passenger seat of the lamborghini and drive home. Isaiah gets home safely with a llama, while he happily kicks his feet to sleep.</p>
