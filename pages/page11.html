    <p class="myBorder">Isaiah decides that Soulja is the one….he couldn't have been more right. Isaiah and Soulja would go on to create bootleg versions of whatever was popping at the time and remixing old songs.  They would slightly alter the lyrics, add some random instrument, and insert absurd adlibs. They made millions. Songs such as, “Kiss me Through the FaceTime”, “NAHHHH!”, “Turn My Drip On, Twist That”, “Ricky and Morty”, “Gi's and M's, were among some of their greatest hits. Drake hung up the mic soon after because there was no way he could ever surpass the likes of Zay and Soulja. However, there was one man crazy enough to try. So crazy he just might be able to pull it off….his name….was FUnkY FrEsH KEn.
