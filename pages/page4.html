    <p>Isaiah hops inside the Lamborghini and heads to the nearest Gas station which by convenience also has a McDonalds next to it. Isaiah put 5 dollars into the tank to at least make it home. Isaiah gets super sad because that was his only 5 bucks in his wallet. Does Isaiah still want his Happy Meal after spending so much money on gas, or does he go home hungry.</p>
