        convenience also has a McDonalds
        next to it. Isaiah put 5 dollars into the tank to at least make it home. Isaiah gets super sad because that was
        his only 5 bucks in his wallet. Does Isaiah still want his Happy Meal after spending so much money on gas, or
        does he go home hungry.</p>
